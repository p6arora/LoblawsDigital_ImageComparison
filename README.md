## Introduction

For this assignment, my objective was to make a tool which compared 2 images for similarity and rank them accordingly. It was an open-ended assignment and I had the option to choose whichever stack I would deem the best option. My prefered stack was:

* Python
* OpenCV

The justifications for my design and alternative design are explored in the Design subsection
